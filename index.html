    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I was born in Mexico but raised in New Mexico. I enjoyed growing up there because I would hike often. I joined the US Army in 2016 and was stationed in Georgia, where I currently reside. Life in Georgia is hot and humid, but temporary as I am waiting for my husband to finish out his contract here. I left the military in 2022 and now focus on learning about coding!

    <h2>Educational History</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Certification as a Biomedical Equipment Technician</li>
      <li>Certification in Radiographic/Fluoroscopic Imaging Systems</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Job Experience</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I tend to commit to jobs for long periods of time. I mainly have had 2 jobs,  working in a restaurant and working for the Army. Each one requiring certain skills.
     <ul> 
       <li>Lead supervisor roles in each one. In the restaurant I worked my way up to an assistant manager position. In the Army worked my way through 5 ranks to the supervisor level.</li> 
       <li>Created staff schedules and manage the daily tasks needed to operate a restaurant smoothly.</li>
       <li>Supervised soldiers appointed to me. I managed exercise routines and job training in the biomedical field. Together we would service and repair hospital equipment and ensure any other mission goals were met.</li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <br>
     <p>My current number one goal is getting through the Code Fellows program. Afterwards, it is to find a job I enjoy and can fully submerge myself into. Personal goals that are a little more down the road would be to improve my run time, volunteer in the comminity (maybe at a library), and saving more!</p>
